The agent will have four possible actions and it has to choose one of the possible actions on each timestep. 
1) Move forward
2) Move backward
3) Move Left
4) Move Right

The agent would be deemed successful if it has been able to collect +13.0 rewards over 100 episodes. 
# Getting Started
First step is to download the environment based on the operating system a person has. Following are the operating systems that are
available, 
For this project, you will not need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

Linux: click here
Mac OSX: click here
Windows (32-bit): click here
Windows (64-bit): click here
Then, place the file in the p1_navigation/ folder in the course GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

(For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not enabled a virtual screen), then please use this link to obtain the "headless" version of the environment. You will not be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent. (To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to enable a virtual screen, and then download the environment for the Linux operating system above.)
