### Introduction Project Navigation
For this project, an agent would be trained to navigate and collect bananas. 

The agent will have four possible actions and it has to choose one of the possible actions on each timestep. 
1) Move forward
2) Move backward
3) Move Left
4) Move Right

The agent would be deemed successful if it has been able to collect +13.0 rewards over 100 episodes.
